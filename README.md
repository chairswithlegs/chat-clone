# Chat Room Clone

This project is a Chat Room web app built on Angular, Express, and MongoDB. 


## Getting Started

Note: to setup this project, you will (Node)[https://nodejs.org/en/] and a (Mongo)[https://www.mongodb.com/] database.

Clone this repository using the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/chairswithlegs/chat-clone.git


### Installation

Start by installing the dependencies for the frontend and backend parts of the application. Navigate to the *ChatFrontend* directory and install the frontend dependencies by executing the following command:

    npm install

Once the frontend dependencies have been installed, navigate to the *ChatBackend* directory and install the backend dependencies by executing the same command.

    npm install

The last step is to configure the backend - this can be done by modifying the following values in *ChatBackend/config.js*. 

    jwtKey: <Secret Key>,
    connectionString: <MongoDB Connection String>

The JWT key can be any string (remember to make it sufficiently random), while the connection string will be the connection string generated by your Mongo database installation. Alternatively, you can set the JWT key and connection string by setting the JWT_KEY and CONNECTION_STRING environment variables.


## Starting The App

Start the backend API by executing the following command in the *ChatBackend* directory (this will start a server listening to the port specifed in the *config..js*):

	npm start

Next, fire up the Angular app by entering the following in the *ChatFrontend* directory:

    ng serve

Finally, navigate to port serving the Angular app (*localhost:4200* by default) to checkout the app.


## Running the tests

To test the frontend (Angular), navigate to the *ChatFrontend* directory and type:

    ng test

To test the backend (Express Server), navigate to the *ChatBackend* directory and type:

	npm test
